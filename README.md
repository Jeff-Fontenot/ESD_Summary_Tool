# ESD Summary Tool

A PowerShell automation script designed for Marine Corps Enterprise Service Desk (ESD) analysts to quickly retrieve user, workstation, and printer information from Active Directory without navigating multiple administrative interfaces.

## üéØ Problem Solved

As an ESD analyst, retrieving basic information about users, workstations, or printers typically requires:
- Logging into multiple administrative consoles
- Navigating between 4+ different screens per lookup
- Several minutes per call just to gather basic information

**This script consolidates those lookups into a single, menu-driven interface that delivers comprehensive summaries in seconds.**

## ‚ú® Features

- **User Summary**: Look up users by username or email, get comprehensive AD info including group memberships, O365/Adobe licensing, and Exchange attributes
- **Printer Summary**: Find AD print queues and map to local printer status
- **Workstation Summary**: Search computers by name or serial number with smart search (exact ‚Üí prefix ‚Üí contains)
- **System Resources**: Quick CPU and memory usage for analyst workstations
- **Clipboard Integration**: All summaries can be automatically copied to clipboard for easy pasting into tickets
- **Grid Selection**: Interactive selection when multiple results are found
- **Fast Performance**: Optimized AD queries with efficient search patterns

## üìã Requirements

- PowerShell 7.3+ (tested on 7.3.1)
- Active Directory PowerShell module (RSAT)
- Domain-joined machine with appropriate AD read permissions
- Windows environment with clipboard access

## üöÄ Installation

1. Download `ESD-Summary.ps1` to your preferred location (recommended: `C:\Scripts\`)
2. Ensure execution policy allows script execution:
   ```powershell
   Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
   ```
3. Run the script:
   ```powershell
   # From the script directory
   .\ESD-Summary.ps1
   
   # From anywhere (update path as needed)
   & "C:\Scripts\ESD-Summary.ps1"
   ```

## üìñ Usage

The script launches an interactive menu with 5 options:

- Contains matching (comprehensive)

**Provides:**
- Computer name and enabled status
- Serial number (cleaned format)

## üîß Advanced Usage

### Function-Level Access

All menu functions can be called directly for scripting or advanced use:

```powershell
# Get user info with clipboard copy
Get-EsdUserSummary -Identity "john.doe" -Copy

# Search workstation with grid selection
Get-EsdWorkstationSummary -Query "DESKTOP" -Grid

# Printer lookup
Get-EsdPrinterSummary -PrinterName "HP-LaserJet-B210"

# System resources
Get-EsdSystemResources
```

### Parameters

- `-Copy`: Automatically copy formatted summary to clipboard
- `-Grid`: Show interactive picker when multiple results found
- `-SearchBase`: Limit workstation search to specific OU (faster)
- `-Server`: Specify domain controller for queries

## üí° Tips for Best Performance

1. **Workstation searches**: Use exact computer names when possible for fastest results
2. **User lookups**: Email addresses work as well as usernames
